# Scrollytelling with Quarto

Scrollytelling stories let you explain complicated concepts to readers as they scroll down the page. You could build up a complicated plot layer-by-layer, zoom in on a famous map, highlight a key quote from an interviewee, or even animate your own web graphics.

This is my first financial report presented in a scrolltelling.
